## 🌐 What I Do

- **Reverse engineering**  
  Windows APIs, memory protection, injection primitives, patching routines

- **Workflow design**  
  Clean prototypes, annotated guides, runtime confirmation with breakpoints

- **Roblox security**  
  Anticheat thinking, exploit analysis, Lua systems

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- **Clarity-first engineering**  
  Decompile → map → annotate → confirm

- **Legitimacy & reputation**  
  Transparent docs, code signing, vendor engagement

---

## 📂 Selected Work

- Injection primitives mapped & confirmed  
- C-style prototypes for memory ops  
- Anticheat experiments and hardening
